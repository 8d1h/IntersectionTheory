Let X be such a variety. A k-cycle on X is a formal linear combination of codimension-k subvarieties with rational coefficients, and a k-class is an equivalent class of cycles modulo numerical equivalence (see below).

This will allow us to introduce parameters and do some symbolic computations.\nUsually the rational equivalence is used for defining the Chow ring. But this is too fine an equivalence for us: we are actually working with numerical equivalence, that is, we only care about the intersection numbers with respect to classes in complementary codimension. This is enough for most enumerative problems, and another advantage is that we can deduce the pushforward of a morphism when only the pullback is known (see Morphisms for details).\nIn many cases, we won't be able to compute the entire Chow ring: we will only be able to obtain information on a certain subring generated by some tautological classes. Therefore we are actually working with the class of all varieties that share the same piece of tautological ring (see A \"non-algebraic\" example for a typical example).\nFor some nice varieties, the numerical equivalence coincides with the rational equivalence. In this case the Chow ring coincides with the rational cohomology ring and can be completely computed, so both problems disappear. A nice consequence is that the Betti numbers of the Chow ring are exactly the (even) Betti numbers of the variety itself, so we have an equality sum(betti(X)) == euler(X). The class of these varieties includes projective spaces, Grassmannians, homogeneous spaces for affine algebraic groups (e.g., flag varieties), and in general any variety with an affine stratification. Moreover, products, projective bundles, and blowups with center in this class will remain in this class. Internally, we use set_special(X, :alg => true) to declare that X satisfies this property.
